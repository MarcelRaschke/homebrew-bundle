# Homebrew/bundle (merged into Homebrew/brew)

This tap provided Bundler for non-Ruby dependencies from e.g. Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, Mac App Store and Visual Studio Code. It has been entirely merged into [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew). `brew bundle` still works as before, it just isn't in this tap any more.
